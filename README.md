# Disaster Victim Detection using Deep Learning & Machine Learning

This project identifies disaster victims in images using a hybrid AI approach. Features are extracted with ResNet50 CNN and classified using ML models like SVM and Random Forest.

## Model Architecture
- ResNet50: Pretrained CNN for feature extraction
- Classifiers: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

## Output
- Classified images showing presence/absence of disaster victims
- Accuracy and F1-score metrics for each classifier

## Status
Completed and tested
